NOTES:

A wave is the disturbance produce in the medium from an equilibrium condition which travels with the finite velocity in the region of space.
Wave motion transfers energy from one point to another, which may or may not displace particles of the medium.
If the vibrating particles of the medium oscillate to the same direction of propagation of the wave is called a longitudinal wave.
If the wave travels from one region to another region is called a progressive wave. 
Transverse wave and longitudinal wave are both progressive wave.




EXERCISE:

What do you mean by a wave ?
A wave is the disturbance produce in the medium from an equilibrium condition which travels with the finite velocity in the region of space.

What are the types of wave motion ?
The types of wave motion are:
1. Transverse wave motion
2. Longitudinal wave motion

What do you mean by Longitudinal wave motion ?
If the particles of the medium vibrate to the direction of the propagation of the wave, then the wave motion is called longitudinal wave motion.
